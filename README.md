# My-Fantasy-League-Google-Sheets-Scripts
A bunch of function for retrieving and writing MFL data into a google sheet.
5 menu items and 5 functions.
Added formulas to the scripts so they would be automatically filled in with the data from MFL
Assigned specific sheet names to specifc functions.  Added a Retrieve All Data menu item that runs all 5 functions.  Created a private function to retrun the json.
